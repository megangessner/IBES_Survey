# IBES_Survey

This is the code in progress for the JS-based IBES survey. settings.json contains relevant settings and language previously stored in XML files, for easier reading into JS. steps.js contains classes used to make the system object-oriented. Not all steps have been initialized yet, only through step 3. Dragula is used for drag and drop functionality.
